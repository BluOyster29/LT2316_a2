8,What a vacuous response to the Budget.,He presented almost no policies.,0
9,"Often when I speak with the environmentalists, they seem to regard economic growth as the enemy; it is not, and let me explain why.","Over the past two centuries, Europe and north America have managed through economic growth to raise almost one third of the population of this world out of a life of hunger, hardship and disease.",0
10,"I do not like the treaty: some parts may not be as bad as others but, on balance, I do not want it to be brought into law.","I think that the treaty marks a sea change in this country's relationship with the EU, and that it will result in much faster incremental change than in the past.",0

18,"In the years preceding the financial crisis, the credit rating agencies fuelled a dangerous liquidity boom by underestimating the credit default risks of sub-prime mortgages and complex structured products.","When the bubble burst, sudden downgrades to the ratings embedded in the investment plans, mandates and capital reserve requirements automatically triggered a liquidity crisis which, in effect, made a bad situation much worse.",0
19,"They must also determine whether councils will be reasonably certain about the money that they will get, and whether they will get the right help to enable them to meet local need and changing circumstances.","The problem with the Bill, and the reason that we will oppose it tonight, is that it does not give the reassurance that many people are looking for on those five fundamental principles, either on local government funding or on the localisation of council tax benefit.",0

22,"Every month of inaction, every failed initiative and every growth forecast downgraded is another hammer blow to the work force, our businesses and our national infrastructure.","The skills and motivation of British workers are going to waste, with one in three of our 2.5 million unemployed out of work for more than a year and 3 million of those with jobs wanting to work more hours, but unable to find the work.",0

34,"However, I always felt that that authority came from and was vested in the majority group.",I was always pleased to take what I wanted to do to the group.,0
35,"So, that is where we are with differential pay.","For the avoidance of doubt, in the draft regulations published by the Under-Secretary there is no reference to pay differentiation, which means that if they were approved by Parliament as they are now, the practice would not be lawful at all.",0
36,"The criteria for the scheme were deprivation, crime rates and the proportion of the small retailers that we were most interested in helping.","The criteria were agreed by the retail crime steering group, and the FSB is not only an active member, but it agreed with the criteria and the principle.",0
37,"We saw a number of positive examples of how the &#163;175 billion of public procurement can be used to promote equality, and I am pleased at that.","Equal pay is the issue on which there has been most opposition, with people saying that some provisions would be a burden on business; at least that is how I interpreted what was being said when we were told that the issue was difficult.",0

50,"Secondly, we will link our work on water, sanitation and hygiene especially closely with our work on health.","We cannot achieve other key millennium development goal targets in the absence of action on something as fundamental as basic water supply, sanitation and hygiene promotion.",0

	""persuade the government of Sri Lanka to allow international oversight of all internally displaced persons"".","It also rightly refers to the need for
	""a transparent registration process and improved conditions within the camps with better access to food, water and medical facilities""
